# UI for share-elm.com

Requires [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) for building and testing the source files.

Other requirements are [bean](https://npmjs.org/package/bean), [iris](https://npmjs.org/package/iris), [curry](https://npmjs.org/package/curry), and [underscore](https://npmjs.org/package/underscore) modules, all available through the node package manager.

index.html is an example file. The actual site uses a modified version to fit the server-side template engine.

NOTE: This is very alpha and will probably be changing radically, as share-elm.com is a fresh site with goals that are not set in stone.
